    "1. **Persistence** = Saving the graph's state so it survives across multiple\n",
    "   `.invoke()` calls. Without it, every call starts from a blank slate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Checkpoint** = A snapshot of the graph's state at a point in time.\n",
    "   LangGraph auto-saves one after each node runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **InMemorySaver** = A simple checkpointer that stores checkpoints in RAM.\n",
    "   (For production, you'd use SqliteSaver or PostgresSaver.)\n",

    "4. **thread_id** = Identifies a conversation. Same thread_id = same memory.\n",
